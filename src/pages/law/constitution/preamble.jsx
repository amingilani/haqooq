        <p>Wherein the principles of democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance and social justice, as enunciated by Islam, shall be fully observed;</p>
        <p>Wherein the Muslims shall be enabled to order their lives in the individual and collective spheres in accordance with the teachings and requirements of Islam as set out in the Holy Quran and Sunnah;</p>
        <p>Wherein adequate provision shall be made for the minorities freely to profess and practise their religions and develop their cultures;</p>
        <p>Wherein the territories now included in or in accession with Pakistan and such other territories as may hereafter be included in or accede to Pakistan shall form a Federation wherein the units will be autonomous with such boundaries and limitations on their powers and authority as may be prescribed;</p>

        <p>Faithful to the declaration made by the Founder of Pakistan, Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, that Pakistan would be a democratic State based on Islamic principles of social justice;</p>
        <p>Dedicated to the preservation of democracy achieved by the unremitting struggle of the people against oppression and tyranny;</p>
        <p>Inspired by the resolve to protect our national and political unity and solidarity by creating an egalitarian society through a new order;</p>
